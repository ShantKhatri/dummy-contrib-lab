# Contributing Guidelines

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in your Pull Request being closed without review.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a new branch from `main`
4. Open an Issue before starting work
5. Make changes in a single logical commit
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request using the template

## Branch Naming
- feat/<short-description>
- fix/<short-description>
- docs/<short-description>

Examples:
- feat/update-readme
- fix/typo-placeholder

## Commit Messages
Use Conventional Commits:

- feat: add new feature
- fix: fix a bug
- docs: documentation only changes
- chore: maintenance tasks

## Good example:
docs: improve README clarity


## Commit History
- Squash commits if needed
- One PR = one logical change
**Example:**  
If your pull request contains multiple small commits (such as formatting fixes or incremental updates), squash them into a single logical commit before opening the PR.

This helps keep the commit history clean and makes reviews easier for maintainers.

## Pull Requests
- Must reference an Issue
- Must fill out the PR template completely
- Vague descriptions will result in closure

## Draft Pull Requests

Draft Pull Requests should be used when work is still in progress.

Use a Draft PR when:
- The implementation is incomplete
- You want early feedback on approach or direction
- Tests or documentation are not finalized

Mark the PR as **Ready for Review** only when:
- The change is complete
- The commit history is clean
- The PR description accurately reflects the change

Using Draft PRs appropriately helps reviewers understand intent
and prevents premature reviews.


## Communication
- Do not ask "Can I work on this?"
- Do not ask questions already answered in docs
- Be precise and respectful of reviewer time
