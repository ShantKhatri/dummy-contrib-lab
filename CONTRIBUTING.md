# Contributing Guidelines

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in your Pull Request being closed without review.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a new branch from `main`
4. Open an Issue before starting work
5. Make changes in a single logical commit
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request using the template

## Branch Naming
- feat/<short-description>
- fix/<short-description>
- docs/<short-description>

Examples:
- feat/update-readme
- fix/typo-placeholder

## Commit Messages
Use Conventional Commits:

- feat: add new feature
- fix: fix a bug
- docs: documentation only changes
- chore: maintenance tasks

## Good example:
docs: improve README clarity


## Commit History
- Squash commits if needed
- One PR = one logical change

## Pull Requests
- Must reference an Issue
- Must fill out the PR template completely
- Vague descriptions will result in closure

## Pull Request Description Format

To make the review process as smooth as possible, your Pull Request description **must** follow this template.

---

### 1. Closes: #<issue_number>

*   **Description:** A brief, one-sentence summary of the changes.

### 2. Changes Made

*   A bulleted list of the specific changes you have made.
*   *Example: Updated the `README.md` to include a new "Getting Started" section.*
*   *Example: Fixed a typo in `placeholder.txt`.*

### 3. How to Test

*   Step-by-step instructions on how a reviewer can verify your changes.
*   *Example: 1. `cat README.md` and confirm the new section is present.*

## Communication
- Do not ask "Can I work on this?"
- Do not ask questions already answered in docs
- Be precise and respectful of reviewer time
