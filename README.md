# Dummy Contribution Lab

This repository is used to simulate real-world open-source contribution workflows.

The goal is not to write complex code.
The goal is to demonstrate professional Git hygiene, communication clarity, and respect for maintainer time.

## Who This Is For
- Students preparing for GSoC or serious open-source work
- Developers who want to fix bad Git and PR habits early

## What This Repo Is NOT
- A playground
- A tutorial
- A place for unreviewed commits

## Contribution Rules (Read Carefully)
- All contributions must start with an Issue
- All Pull Requests must follow the provided template
- Commit history must be clean and meaningful
- Pull Requests that violate guidelines may be closed without comment

## Repository Purpose

This repository is intentionally minimal and is meant to help contributors
learn real-world open-source contribution workflows.

The focus is on small, focused contributions such as documentation updates
or clarity improvements that demonstrate good Git hygiene, clear
communication, and respect for maintainer time.

If this feels strict, that is intentional.
